            <p>
                Demonstrate a variety of interactive exercises using Calculus II problems (for some reason).

                    If given as a pre-class activity or uncollected set of exercises in class (so printing would not be necessary), it might make sense to have interactive exercises that check answers and give some sort of feedback.

  <statement correct="no">
    <p>
      Suppose <m>\{a_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}</m> is a sequence such that <m>\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = 0</m>. Can you conclude that the series <m>\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n</m> converges?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <feedback>
    <p>
        Check your notes from last class to find a counterexample.
    </p>
  </feedback>
  <hint>
    <p>
        The fact that <m>\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x) = 0</m> does not imply <m>\int_{a}^{\infty}f(x)\,dx</m> necessarily converges. You can apply the integral test to series.

    Here's a MyOpenMath problem. They are very easy to include.

        Here is a Webwork problem. (Hoping that a new FLC Webwork server, which will more closely resemble what you see here, will be up by Fall.) Using variants of actual assigned Webwork problems can be helpful in building student confidence when they do their assigned homework.
